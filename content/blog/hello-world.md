I've been interested in the idea of 'active externalism' - in (very) rough terms, that an individual's mental states (hopes, fears, desires) are not fully contained within themselves & their mind.[^1]

A simple example would be storing your thoughts in a notebook, and retrieving them later.  

After learning about the capabilities of LLMs and similar technology, my immediate thought was to use those systems to extend the bounds of the human brain.  

Let this blog serve as my own 'notebook' and catalogue of what I learn along the way.
